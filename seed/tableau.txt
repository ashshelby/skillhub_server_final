Course Duration: 40 hours
Objective

Tableau is a widely renowned business intelligence (BI) and mapping functionality relied on by companies such as Amazon, Experian, and Unilever. The main objective behind using this software is its ease to explore, visualize and securely share data in the form of Workbooks and Dashbooks. Tableau has plot latitude and longitude coordinates that are used to connect spatial files like Esri Shapefiles, KML, and GeoJSON to present custom geography. The group geographics can be used to create custom territories or to apply custom geocoding to extend the existing geographic roles in the outcome. The built-in geo-coding allows the administrative areas (country, state, district), postal code, Airports, US Congressional Districts, and European Union Statistical areas to be allocated automatically.
