Red Hat Linux (System Administration)
Course Duration: 80 hours
Objective

Red Hat Linux consists of the course structure in three levels for beginners to professionals where in level 1 we have Linux System and Networking Administration, in level 2 we have Linux System and Networking Administration and in level 3 we have Linux System and Networking Administration.
About Course

Red Hat Linux course is one of the popular certification course designed for networking professionals operating the Red Hat Operating System. The main motive of the course is to provide technical skills to networking engineers so that they can manage Red Hat Linux. The course encourages the networking professionals interested in open source technology to become more familiar with Linux network administration. In this course you will learn to:

    Operate Red Hat System Administration
    Efficiently setup, configure and manage Red Hat servers
    Configure system logging and remote logging
    Implement secure networking services in Linux environment

Course Overview

Target Group

    Anyone who has worked and is familiar with any applications of UNIX (Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX etc.) as a user (not necessarily as an administrator), or have done some system administration on Windows NT, you will find the course to be attainable.
